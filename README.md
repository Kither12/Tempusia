Today I realize that it has been a year since I released my first game on Steam. Sadly, the game was died :((. After talking a look at my old scripts, which is very nostalgic, I decide to upload all of it into github. Sorry for not uploading any resources of the game.

Also if you want to take a look of the game, here is the link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2054730/Tempusia/

Steam doesn't allow me to change the price to free so if you want to have free key to play, you can ask me. Or just donate for me <(")
